<h1>What Is Birdfeed?</h1>
<p>
  Birdfeed is a subscription service to DIRTYBIRD, the record label & events company and all-around awesome company.
</p>
<p>
  We want to have a direct line to our most important people on earth - you, our fans - so we can get you the music releases first, exclusive releases that you canâ€™t find anywhere else, ticket discounts to shows (and sometimes free tickets), meet and greets with the artists and discounts off label merchandise.
</p>
<p>
  When you sign up for this service, you will be able to access 3 months worth of past releases, plus 2 back catalog releases of our choice. This service is only $6.99/month or $75.00 annually. You can quit at any time and the first month is FREE!
